title: About Hugo Ivy
---

This uses a Hugo theme that was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy) by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy).

Like Ivy, Hugo-Ivy is also released under [the Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense), which basically means you just do whatever you want.
